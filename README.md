# SurvivalPredict

WIP.

A micro package centered around using Survival Analysis for predicting survival at various times, modeled after scikit-learn. Unlike traditional Survival Analysis, there is a focus on administrative censorship; where censorship is a function of survival and calendar time, and not due to a loss of follow up. Administrative censorship is  the correct way to treat censorship in the case of customer churn and lead conversion. There will be an effort to bring cross validation and other statistical learning tuning techniques to  Survival Analysis.
